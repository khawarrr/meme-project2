### Description
Meme is a concept that is shared from person to person. Meme describes social ideas, current events and many other things. 

#### History
While memes today are recognized as amusing or interesting items that spread widely through the internet, the word itself dates to the 1970s. Originally "memes" were conceptualized as units of cultural transfer, and could be boiled down to "ideas that catch on and pass between people via culture."
